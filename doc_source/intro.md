# What is AWS Secrets Manager?<a name="intro"></a>

* application's credentials | history
  * embed the credentials | application
  * when rotation credentials came -> update the application / use the new credentials
  * when applications distributed (-> multiple applications) -> you needed to update ALL
    * -> by laziness, NO rotations are done

* AWS Secrets Manager
  * -- enables you to -- replace hardcoded credentials | your code
    * ðŸ‘€-- via -- API call to Secrets Manager ðŸ‘€
      * benefits
        * if someone examine your code -> secret can NOT be compromised
        * automatic rotation can be configured

## Basic AWS Secrets Manager scenario<a name="intro-basic-scenario"></a>

* goal
  * MOST basic scenario
* scenario
  * credentials to access to a database
    * stored | Secrets Manager
    * used by an application

        ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/images/ASM-Basic-Scenario.png)

1. The database administrator -- creates a -- set of credentials | Personnel database /
   1. used by an application -- MyCustomApp
   2. configured / the application -- can access to the -- Personnel database
2. The database administrator -- stores the credentials as a -- secret | Secrets Manager (named *MyCustomAppCreds*\)
   1. -> Secrets Manager 
      1. encrypts
      2. stores the credentials -- as the -- *protected secret text*\.
3. if MyCustomApp wants to access the database -> the application -- queries -- Secrets Manager
4. Secrets Manager 
   1. retrieves the secret,
   2. decrypts the protected secret text
   3. returns the secret -- via HTTPS with TLS, to the -- client app
5. The client application
   1. parses the credentials,
   2. connection string,
   3. uses it, -- to access the -- database server

## Features of AWS Secrets Manager<a name="features"></a>
* TODO:
### Programmatically retrieve encrypted secret values at runtime<a name="features_retrieve-by-label"></a>

Secrets Manager helps you improve your security posture by removing hard\-coded credentials from your application source code, and by not storing credentials within the application, in any way\. Storing the credentials in or with the application subjects them to possible compromise by anyone who can inspect your application or the components\. Since you have to update your application and deploy the changes to every client before you can deprecate the old credentials, this process makes rotating your credentials difficult\. 

Secrets Manager enables you to replace stored credentials with a runtime call to the Secrets Manager Web service, so you can retrieve the credentials dynamically when you need them\. 

Most of the time, your client requires access to the most recent version of the encrypted secret value\. When you query for the encrypted secret value, you can choose to provide only the secret name or Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\), without specifying any version information at all\. If you do this, Secrets Manager automatically returns the most recent version of the secret value\.

However, other versions can exist at the same time\. Most systems support secrets more complicated than a simple password, such as full sets of credentials including the connection details, the user ID, and the password\. Secrets Manager allows you to store multiple sets of these credentials at the same time\. Secrets Manager stores each set in a different version of the secret\. During the secret rotation process, Secrets Manager tracks the older credentials, as well as the new credentials you want to start using, until the rotation completes\.

### Store different types of secrets<a name="features_storing-secrets"></a>

Secrets Manager enables you to store text in the encrypted secret data portion of a secret\. This typically includes the connection details of the database or service\. These details can include the server name, IP address, and port number, as well as the user name and password used to sign in to the service\. For details on secrets, see the [maximum and minimum values](reference_limits.html#reference_limits_max-min)\. The protected text doesn't include:
+  Secret name and description
+  Rotation or expiration settings
+  ARN of the KMS key associated with the secret
+ Any attached AWS tags 

### Encrypt your secret data<a name="features_kms-encryption"></a>

Secrets Manager encrypts the protected text of a secret by using [AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/)\. Many AWS services use AWS KMS for key storage and encryption\. AWS KMS ensures secure encryption of your secret when at rest\. Secrets Manager associates every secret with a KMS key\. It can be either AWS managed key for Secrets Manager for the account \(`aws/secretsmanager`\), or a customer managed key you create in AWS KMS\. 

Whenever Secrets Manager encrypt a new version of the protected secret data, Secrets Manager requests AWS KMS to generate a new data key from the KMS key\. Secrets Manager uses this data key for [envelope encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#enveloping)\. Secrets Manager stores the encrypted data key with the protected secret data\. Whenever the secret needs decryption, Secrets Manager requests AWS KMS to decrypt the data key, which Secrets Manager then uses to decrypt the protected secret data\. Secrets Manager never stores the data key in unencrypted form, and always disposes the data key immediately after use\.

In addition, Secrets Manager, by default, only accepts requests from hosts using open standard [Transport Layer Security \(TLS\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) and [Perfect Forward Secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy)\. Secrets Manager ensures encryption of your secret while in transit between AWS and the computers you use to retrieve the secret\.

### Automatically rotate your secrets<a name="features_autorotate"></a>

* Secrets Manager can rotate credentials automatically 
  * for
    * [*natively* supported AWS databases](#databases-with-fully-configured-and-ready-to-use-rotation-supporta-namefull-rotation-supporta)
      * *natively*  == NO additional programming
    * OTHER databases or services
      * requirements
        * create a custom Lambda function 
  * automatically == NO user intervention + scheduled
  * ðŸ‘€rotation -- is done via an -- AWS Lambda function / perform the tasks: ðŸ‘€
    + Creates a new version of the secret
    + Stores the secret | Secrets Manager
    + Configures the protected service -- to use the -- new version
    + Verifies the new version
    + Marks the new version -- as -- production ready

* Staging labels
  * uses
    * keep track of the different versions of your secrets 
  * rules
    * allowed >= 1 / version
    * each staging label -- can ONLY be attached to -- 1! version 
  * `AWSCURRENT`
    * ðŸ‘€== label | currently active & in-use version of the secret ðŸ‘€

### Control access to secrets<a name="features_control-access"></a>

You can attach AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) permission policies to your users, groups, and roles that grant or deny access to specific secrets, and restrict management of those secrets\. For example, you might attach one policy to a group with members that require the ability to fully manage and configure your secrets\. Another policy attached to a role used by an application might grant only read permission on the one secret the application needs to run\.

Alternatively, you can attach a resource\-based policy directly to the secret to grant permissions specifying users who can read or modify the secret and the versions\. Unlike an identity\-based policy which automatically applies to the user, group, or role, a resource\-based policy attached to a secret uses the `Principal` element to identify the target of the policy\. The `Principal` element can include users and roles from the same account as the secret or principals from other accounts\.
